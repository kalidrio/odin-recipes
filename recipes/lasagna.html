	<p>The perfect lasagna recipe made with parmesan ricotta 
		cheese filling, melted mozzarella cheese ...
	</p>
	<h4>Ingredients:</h4>
	<ul>
		<li>1 Tablespoon Olive Oil</li>
		<li>1 small Onion (finely diced)</li>
		<li>1 lb. Lean Ground Beef</li>
		<li>3/4 teaspoon Garlic Powder</li>
		<li>3/4 teaspoon salt</li>
	</ul>
	<h4>Steps:</h4>
	<ol>
		<li><b>Start by making a homemade meat sauce.</b></li>
		<p>
			This is done by sauteing an onion in olive oil untli it begins
			to soften. This brings out the sweet flavor of the onion.
			Then it is time to brown the ground beef until it is browned and
			the onion is softened. Stir in the marinara sauce and let it simmer
			on low. If you want your lasagna to be extra saucy, I suggest adding 1/2 jar
			more marinara sauce.
		</p>
		<li><b>Make a parmesan ricotta cheese mixture.</b></li>
		<P>
			This is what gives the lasagna the creamy filling. I love to flavor the ricotta 
			cheese with a good amount of parmesan cheese, spices, and egg to bind it together.
		</P>
		<li><b>Use your favorite lasagna noodles.</b></li>
		<p>
			There are two choices for lasagna noodles- oven-ready pre-cooked noodles 
			or lasagna noodles that need to be cooked before hitting the oven. I have tried both ways
			and can attest that they both work!
		</p>
		<li><b>Bring on the cheese!</b></li>
		<p>
			The best lasagna is full of cheese so be generous with the layers of mozzarella cheese.
		</p>
		<li><b>Bake covered for 15 minutes</b></li>
		<p>
			and then remove the foil and continue to cook until the cheese is bubbly. 
			Let is set up for 10 minutes before serving.
